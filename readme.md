# Data Visualizations and Car Thefts – Ottawa Case Study

## Description
This project showcases how to transform raw and unclear charts into meaningful, clear, and visually compelling graphics using the principles of effective data visualization. It focuses on vehicle theft data in Ottawa from 2015 to 2023.

## Objective
To apply best practices in data visualization by refining a bar chart, line chart, and pie chart using Gestalt principles, preattentive attributes, and visual design techniques that enhance clarity, interpretation, and audience engagement.

## Project Structure
1. **Bar Chart** – Car Theft by Vehicle Type
